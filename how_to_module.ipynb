    "2. **Don't keep any unused code and/or code cells in the notebook.** When revising or going through notebooks, be sure to delete any code cells or code that isn't used at all, in order to improve the student's readability.\n",
    "3. **Don't forget to provide documentation / explanations for any work you share with developers and leads!** If you're not writing text descriptions for your part of the notebook, that's okay -- but always include comments or other ways of explaining your thought process to make co-developing with team members easier!"

    "1. **Try to establish concrete learning objectives with your team lead and/or the professor.** A lot of the time, the learning objectives can give you a generic outline of what the order of the notebook should look like.\n",
    "2. **Reference previous notebooks and/or course materials.** If you're working on a notebook in which your domain knowledge is limited, that's okay! The best place to start is by looking through any previous notebooks that were developed for the course and/or course materials available to you. From this you can usually gain some valuable insight when you go through the materials as someone who is seeing it for the first time.\n",
    "3. **Create an outline for yourself and fellow devs working on the task.** If you're working on the notebook with other devs, it's important to make sure you're all on the same page and understand your responsibilities! Discussing an overall outline and implementing it in the notebook together is a good place to start."
